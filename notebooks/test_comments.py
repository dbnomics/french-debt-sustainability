    "What is meant by \"publicdebt sustainability\" ? \n"
    "According to international institutions and economist, a public debt is sustainable when the debt service is ensured at all times.\n"
    "Debt service refers to the total amount of principal and interest payments that a borrower, such as a State, is required to make on its debt over a specified period.\n"
    "\n"
    "To fullfil these requirements a State needs to be solvent and liquid.\n"
    "The question of the french debt sustainability has become a hot topic.\n"
    "To repay its debt, France has to borrow on the markets.\n"
    "Public debt cannot increase indefinitely.\n"
    "The government's creditors are beginning to doubt its ability to borrow enough to repay its old debts and finance its deficit.\n"
    "French debt has not stopped growning since the 1980s.\n"
    "Many start to fear that the debt will become unmanageable.\n"
    "One way of stabilising debt is to set the debt-to-GDP ratio.\n"
    "An other, it the reduction of deficit. This reduction can be achieved with the conduct of austerity budgetary policies."
